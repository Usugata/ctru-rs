//! 3DS-specific threading API
//!
//! While it is possible to create threads on the 3DS using functions found in
//! `std::thread`, the standard API does not expose the ability to set a thread's
//! priority level and to pin a thread to a specific CPU core. This module exists
//! to address those and other shortcomings.
//!
//! All 3DS models have at least two CPU cores available to spawn threads on:
//! The application core (appcore) and the system core (syscore). The New 3DS
//! has an additional two cores, the first of which can also run user-created
//! threads.
//!
//! Threads spawned on the appcore are cooperative rather than preemptive. This
//! means that threads must explicitly yield control to other threads (whether
//! via synchronization primitives or explicit calls to `yield_now`) when they
//! are not actively performing work. Failure to do so may result in control
//! flow being stuck in an inactive thread while the other threads are powerless
//! to continue their work.  
//!
//! However, it is possible to spawn one fully preemptive thread on the syscore
//! by using `apt::set_app_cpu_time_limit` to reserve a slice of time for a
//! thread to run. Attempting to run more than one thread at a time on the syscore
//! will result in an error.

/// Spawns a new thread, returning a [`JoinHandle`] for it.
///
/// The join handle will implicitly *detach* the child thread upon being
/// dropped. In this case, the child thread may outlive the parent (unless
/// the parent thread is the main thread; the whole process is terminated when
/// the main thread finishes). Additionally, the join handle provides a [`join`]
/// method that can be used to join the child thread. If the child thread
/// panics, [`join`] will return an [`Err`] containing the argument given to
/// [`panic`].
///
/// This will create a thread using default parameters of [`Builder`], if you
/// want to specify the stack size or the name of the thread, use this API
/// instead.
///
/// As you can see in the signature of `spawn` there are two constraints on
/// both the closure given to `spawn` and its return value, let's explain them:
///
/// - The `'static` constraint means that the closure and its return value
///   must have a lifetime of the whole program execution. The reason for this
///   is that threads can `detach` and outlive the lifetime they have been
///   created in.
///   Indeed if the thread, and by extension its return value, can outlive their
///   caller, we need to make sure that they will be valid afterwards, and since
///   we *can't* know when it will return we need to have them valid as long as
///   possible, that is until the end of the program, hence the `'static`
///   lifetime.
/// - The [`Send`] constraint is because the closure will need to be passed
///   *by value* from the thread where it is spawned to the new thread. Its
///   return value will need to be passed from the new thread to the thread
///   where it is `join`ed.
///   As a reminder, the [`Send`] marker trait expresses that it is safe to be
///   passed from thread to thread. [`Sync`] expresses that it is safe to have a
///   reference be passed from thread to thread.
///

///
/// Panics if the OS fails to create a thread; use [`Builder::spawn`]
/// to recover from such errors.

/// # park and unpark
///
/// Every thread is equipped with some basic low-level blocking support, via the
/// [`thread::park`][`park`] function and [`thread::Thread::unpark`][`unpark`]
/// method. [`park`] blocks the current thread, which can then be resumed from
/// another thread by calling the [`unpark`] method on the blocked thread's
/// handle.
///
/// Conceptually, each [`Thread`] handle has an associated token, which is
/// initially not present:
///
/// * The [`thread::park`][`park`] function blocks the current thread unless or
///   until the token is available for its thread handle, at which point it
///   atomically consumes the token. It may also return *spuriously*, without
///   consuming the token. [`thread::park_timeout`] does the same, but allows
///   specifying a maximum time to block the thread for.
///
/// * The [`unpark`] method on a [`Thread`] atomically makes the token available
///   if it wasn't already.
///
/// In other words, each [`Thread`] acts a bit like a spinlock that can be
/// locked and unlocked using `park` and `unpark`.
///
/// The API is typically used by acquiring a handle to the current thread,
/// placing that handle in a shared data structure so that other threads can
/// find it, and then `park`ing. When some desired condition is met, another
/// thread calls [`unpark`] on the handle.
///
/// The motivation for this design is twofold:
///
/// * It avoids the need to allocate mutexes and condvars when building new
///   synchronization primitives; the threads already provide basic
///   blocking/signaling.
///
/// * It can be implemented very efficiently on many platforms.

//
// This packet itself is then stored into a `JoinInner` which in turns is placed
// in `JoinHandle` and `JoinGuard`. Due to the usage of `UnsafeCell` we need to
// manually worry about impls like Send and Sync. The type `T` should
// already always be Send (otherwise the thread could not have been created) and
// this type is inherently Sync because no methods take &self. Regardless,
// however, we add inheriting impls for Send/Sync to this type to ensure it's
// Send/Sync and that future modifications will still appropriately classify it.
